          Impali Primary School was established in 2016 and officially opened its doors for operation in 2017. Initially the school started with an enrolment of 358 students but has risen to a current enrolment of 637 students. Our mandate is to offer educational services mainly to children of the UNKI Mine employees, the local farming and urban communities surrounding Shurugwi town, however our doors are open to everyone.
